# Mini Web-pages

Welcome to **Mini Web-pages** — a personal collection of **small, creative web projects**.
These are simple interactive pages that I made using **only** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🗂️ Structure

This repo is organized by **project type or idea**. For example:

- `Cutesy/` → small cute pages  
- `Games/` → mini browser-based games  
- `Tools/` → tiny web utilities or interactive scripts  

Each folder contains a standalone web page or project — just run `index.html`.
